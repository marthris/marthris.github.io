<h1>CARDBOARD SURFBOARD</h1>
<P class="infoboks">
AHO, spring semester 2017 <br>
Individual work <br>
Self-initiated project, duration 8 weeks
</p>

<p> Typically, the surfboard core is made of a styrofoam blank that is manually shaped. Styrofoam is easy to shape and very cheap. In this project laser cut cardboard core is used instead. I found it interesting to get experience with how the structure of the cardboard could mimic the material abilities of styrofoam to be a more environmental option to Styrofoam.  The files for the laser cutting are downloaded from Sheldrake.net who has made it possible for anyone to build a surfboard without having any knowledge about surfboard shaping. </p>
