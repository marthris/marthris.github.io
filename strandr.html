<p>Beach wheeler is a wheelchair for a 14 year old boy for use on the beach. The project was in coordination with Santa Barbra Cottage Rehabilitation Hospital and a family that desired beach activities for their son. Due to the limited time we took the starting point of an existing cart and balloon wheels that is already on the market.  Necessary parts were designed and fabricated for integration with the existing frame. A final product was completed and tested to verify the design. The seat was modified so that the user could sit more upright as opposed to lying backwards as the seat was originally designed.</p>
