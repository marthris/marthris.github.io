AHO, fall semester 2017 <br>
Group project <br>
Interaction design<br>
Duration 4 weeks<br>

</p>

<p> This brief was to explore how mobile applications might enhance and expand how citizens interact and related to the city, for Oslo Kommune. The task was to design and communicate a small scale application for mobile phones

<p> The result of this project is the app Vandre, which is an audio and picture guide that takes the user back to episodes in the Oslo history by the use of geo-location </p>

<img  class="padding" src=".\img\telefon_bakgrunn.jpg">
<p>To find a balance between too much information versus to little we decided to have limited the pictures and stories to four available episodes available for one month, changing one every week. The theme of the episodes are big urban planning/housing projects done by Oslo Kommune and private actors done over a “shorter” period of time. These changes are important to the city in that way that they have a big cultural impact and change the demography of the area. The episodes say something about what the planners at that time considered to be important in the future city.</p>
